lilo (1:22.5.7.2-5) unstable; urgency=medium

    debian/lilo.sh sent by Hans Ginzel <hans@matfyz.cz>. (closes: #214653)

    been closed on gcc-3.3.
  * Updated postinst process. Now it detects whether it's necessary to run
    /sbin/lilo and will ask the user to do that. This typically happens when
    upgrading from woody to sarge. I hope this won't be necessary again. Set
    the priority to "medium" because it mostly affects users upgrading from
    woody to sarge. (closes: #214734)

  * Updated lilo.templates. Now it warns the user to run /sbin/lilo if it's an

    booting process (for instance, when upgrading from woody to sarge).
    (closes: #211978)
  * Smart handling of bitmap links on /boot. Removed lilo.links for this 
    purpose and now the linking is made in the postinst process.

lilo (1:21.7.1-0) unstable; urgency=HIGH

  * New upstream release containing minor bug fixes.  Most of the code was
    already in the previous version as Debian specific patches and this release
    brings the Debian version closer to the upstream release.

  * Fixed the keytab-lilo manpage to not be a hack.

  * Fixed the /sbin/lilo wrapper to correctly delete the old files.

  * Changed the way automatic generation of lilo config files operates.
    Now it will grep for "^#AUTOREPLACE$" in /etc/lilo.conf to determine
    whether it should replace the file.
    Closes: #92284

  * Made it rotate /etc/lilo.conf.old on install.

lilo (1:21.7-1) unstable; urgency=HIGH

  * Made it work with devfs style /dev/md/%d devices.

  * Made the lilo wrapper work with `lilo -C "/etc/spare lilo config"` type
    invocation.

  * Now it pre-depends on logrotate, so if you try installing with `dpkg -i`
    and logrotate isn't installed it won't replace the boot.b file that
    /boot/map references if you do another `dpkg -i`.

  * Now installs the Debian MBR as it should.

lilo (1:21-8) unstable; urgency=high

  * Integrated patch from Peter Maydell that fixes:
    - added error checking of various system calls
    - added $DEBUG switch and pulled lilo.conf and fstab filenames
      out into config variables.
    - turned on Perl's -w switch and use strict subs/refs
    - now does examination of current situation up front, separated
      from the logic of what we do in various situations.
    - added check for special marker in /etc/fstab that indicates that we
      are configuring the base filesystem and shouldn't actually do anything.
    Thanks Peter ;)
    Now, if the first line of /etc/fstab is '# UNCONFIGURED FSTAB FOR BASE SYSTEM'
    liloconfig will exit gracefully.
    Anyway, liloconfig should probably be rewritten to use debconf...

  * Set severity of bug #7629 to fixed: This is a perfectly legal option,
    given that the Debian policy is not to install lilo in the MBR by
    default.
  * Reassign bugs #5198, #8280 and #10526 to the package manpages since
    this is where lilo.8 lives. (Does anybody know why BTW?!)
  * Put some (hopefully) usefull comments in the default lilo.conf
    (Fix bug #25174).
  * Include Adam Heath <adam@usa.net>'s patch to add the new
    BOOT_VAR variable (Fix bug #30458).
  * lintian cleaned:
    - fix typo. in description.
    - don't install QuickInst with executable bit set.
    - include lilo.8 manpage (will open a BR on manpages so it
